rd := bufio.NewReader(strings.NewReader(s))
f := fcompl.New(rd, true)   // true if you want to get rid of stopwords
```

Insert Phrases by yourself

```go
f := fcompl.NewTrieNode()
f.InsertPhrase(lineStr, id)
```

Find completion IDs

```go
f.Find("Ball") // [0, 2]
f.Find("bat") // [1]
```

Save and Load

```go
// path compress and save into a file
fcompl.Compress(f)
f.Save("./foo.bin") // default using gob to serialize struct into file

// Load
f, err := fcompl.Load("./foo.bin")
// ...
```
